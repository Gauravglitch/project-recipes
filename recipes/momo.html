<p>Servings: 20-25 momos</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>1/4 cup ghee or oil</li>
  <li>1/2 cup lukewarm water</li>
  <li>Filling ingredients (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound ground meat (beef, pork, or chicken)</li>
  <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Chopped cilantro or scallions for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Make the dough</strong> by combining flour, salt, and baking
    powder in a bowl. Add ghee or oil and mix until the dough comes together.
    Gradually add lukewarm water and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare the filling</strong> by mixing all the filling
    ingredients together in a bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assemble the momos</strong> by dividing the dough into small
    balls. Roll out each ball into a thin circle. Place a tablespoon of filling
    in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to form a
    half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Steam the momos</strong> by placing them in a steamer basket
    lined with parchment paper. Steam for 15-20 minutes or until the dough is
    cooked and the filling is hot.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Serve hot</strong> with your favorite dipping sauce. Garnish
    with chopped cilantro or scallions.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note: You can also pan-fry the momos before steaming for a crispy bottom.
  Simply heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the momos
  for 2-3 minutes on each side before steaming.
